"""Fold an agent-as-provider's own activity back into Xiuqo' turn state.

Agent providers (ACP CLI shims, the codex app-server) run their own tools, so that
work must never come back as pending ``tool_calls`` (Xiuqo would re-run it) — but
the self-improvement loop (replays ``messages``) and the skill-review nudge
(``_iters_since_skill`` counter) go blind if it is merely summarised into
``reasoning``. The client hands back ``xiuqo_projected_messages`` (completed
assistant/tool rows) and ``xiuqo_provider_tool_iterations`` on the completion
object; this helper applies them append-only via ``append_message`` (timestamped,
persisted). Ordinary OpenAI-compatible clients set neither and are unaffected.
